### 1. Bascial Concepts on Machine Learning

**Training set** : a set of $N$ target samples and their labels, $\mathbf{(x_1,y_1)\ldots(x_N,y_N)}$ to fit the predictive model.

**Estimation or training phase** : the process of getting the values of $w$ of the function $f(x,w)$ the best fits the data.

**Generalisation** : the ability to correctly predict the value label of the new test set.

**Supervised and unsupervised learning** : for supervising learning the model should receive the both the data and desired solution (label). Such as *classification* and *regression*. <br>For the unsupervised learning, the feeded data in algorithm don't have the label. Such as *clustering*,*density estimation*,*dimensionality reduction* and *feature selection*.

**Model** : the algorithm and method we want to utilise to transform the questions into various mathematical form to solve the practical questions.

**Objective function** : the criterion of the model to evaluate the precision of the model which is trained by input data and labels. Also it always provides the way for model to re-learn and re-fit the parameters.
